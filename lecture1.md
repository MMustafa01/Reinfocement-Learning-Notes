# Defining Reinforcement learning

But first what is machine learning? \
Machine => Non living entity {***An Agent***}\
Learning => Getting better at a well defined task through a process

There are three major aspects/process for ML:

1.  Supervised
2.  Unsupervised
3.  Reinforcement

Rationale of the course:
1. Introduction to reinforcement learning.
2. Closely similar to how humans and animals learn

We will be using PYTHON language.....Yayyyyy.

Framework => Open AI gymnasium 


Dynamic Programming: Method for optimization, need to check it out


# Actual Lecture:
ML: Learning data to improve the performance of an agent.

Data can be any information received from environment. This could be text, numbers, or environment 

RL: 
An agent performs a certain task repeatedly. And, there is a reward system in place.

Good behavior => is reinforced
Bad Behavior => Rejected

Remember Pavlov's experiment on classical conditioning 



## Exploration and exploitation dilemma
1. Exploration: Doing the same thing that works
2. Checking out the unknown


***State***:

Representation of the environment

Agent  performs an action -> the state changes - > the environment detects the change and then produces a reward signal
