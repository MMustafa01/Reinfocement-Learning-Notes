# Defining Reinforcement learning

But first what is machine learning? \
Machine => Non living entity \
Learning => Getting better at a well defined task through a process

There are three major aspects/process for ML:

1.  Supervised
2.  Unsupervised
3.  Reinforcement

Rationale of the course:
1. Introduction to reinforcement learning.
2. Closely similar to how humans and animals learn
